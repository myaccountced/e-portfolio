                The primary goal of this project is to establish an online platform dedicated to showcasing rescued dogs and effectively communicating the mission and history of the center.
                Second Chance Pups (SCP) aims to expand its reach beyond Saskatoon, connecting with cities and towns across Saskatchewan—and even other provinces.
                NOTE: SCP is a fictional rescue centre.

            This project was created using pair programming, so I developed this website with another classmate.
            The website is built using HTML and CSS, with a bit of JavaScript.
            It demonstrates the ability to produce applications that consider the user experience.
            This is important because creating an application requires thinking about the user's needs and expectations.
            Developing this website involved careful planning—organizing items, deciding what information to display, structuring pages, choosing colors, and identifying the target audience.
            These questions help guide the development of a user-friendly, organized, and dynamic application.
            I learned that, in addition to security and functionality, accessibility and ease of use are also crucial.
            This project also required collaboration, which helped improve my communication skills, as my partner and I had to work closely together throughout the planning, design, and implementation phases.
            <br /><br />
            In the future, I can apply the skills and experience I gained from this project to any collaborative or user-focused development work.
            Understanding how to design with the user in mind will help me build more intuitive and accessible applications.
            This experience has also shown me the value of clear planning and communication, which I will carry into future projects to improve teamwork and efficiency.
            Moving forward, I plan to keep improving my front-end skills and deepen my understanding of user interface design and accessibility.
            One of my goals is to work on larger team-based projects where I can take on more responsibility, apply best practices in UX/UI, and contribute to meaningful, real-world applications.

                The primary goal of this project is to deliver an app based on the requirements of our client.
                The client is a local software development company that agreed to work with Saskpolytech’s CST students as a client.
                The app displays all the events happening in the city, with features that allow users to post and manage events. Moderators also have tools to manage the website.

            This project was created using PHP and Twig for the backend, Doctrine ORM for database management, and Vue, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend.
            It demonstrates the ability to create a full-stack (frontend and backend) application using the Agile framework.
            We also developed automated tests—both backend and frontend—that covered various edge cases.
            <br /><br />
            Note: Agile breaks work into small, manageable chunks (called iterations or sprints), delivers working software frequently, and adapts to change quickly based on feedback.
            <br /><br />
            Throughout this project, we were required to collaborate with other team members (there were seven of us in total) and with a client outside the school.
            The project lasted for four months. During that time, constant communication with both the team and the client was essential.
            We held stand-up meetings, group discussions, and client meetings, which gave me valuable insight into what it's like to work on a real-world project.
            This experience also improved my written communication skills, as much of our communication with the client was through email.
            One of the challenges I faced was learning many of the libraries and frameworks while simultaneously using them in the project.
            This initially slowed down the implementation process, but we managed to meet our deadlines through strong time management, quick problem-solving, and effectively navigating long documentation (especially for languages like PHP).
            Successfully implementing and deploying the project showed that our communication and collaboration were effective.
            It also demonstrated my ability to meet deadlines, learn new technologies quickly, debug code efficiently, and work with other people's code—understanding their structure and documentation along the way.
            <br /><br />
            This project has prepared me well for future work in full-stack development, especially in team environments that follow Agile practices.
            In future projects, I will apply this structured, iterative approach and continue using tools like automated testing, version control, and documentation to ensure code quality and team alignment.
            Looking ahead, I aim to strengthen my backend development skills and gain more experience with scalable architectures and deployment practices.
            A long-term goal is to become a team leader, where I can combine my technical knowledge and growing leadership skills to guide successful software projects.

            I used <a href="https://www.mermaidchart.com/">Mermaid Live Editor</a>, <a href="https://www.drawio.com/">Draw.io</a>, <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>, and Microsoft Word to create these documents.
            Documentation is a crucial part of project development. It helps developers during planning, allows team members to better understand each other’s designs and code, and supports future developers in maintaining or extending the application.
            Initially, I didn't enjoy creating documentation, as I felt it took time away from implementing actual functionality.
            However, I came to appreciate how valuable it is for planning and design. It helped clarify where to start, guided both me and my teammates, and proved especially helpful for the client when we handed over the application.
            This artifact demonstrates my ability to create accurate, detailed, and well-structured documentation.
            It highlights my technical writing skills and my understanding of the software development life cycle—since we had to continuously update the documents as the design evolved.
            <br /><br />
            In future projects, I plan to approach documentation more proactively, knowing how much it improves communication, planning, and long-term maintainability.
            Going forward, I aim to further improve my technical writing and visual communication skills, especially in creating diagrams and user-facing documents.
            A key goal for me is to make documentation a natural and efficient part of my workflow.
            By doing so, I hope to contribute to more organized and professional project environments.
